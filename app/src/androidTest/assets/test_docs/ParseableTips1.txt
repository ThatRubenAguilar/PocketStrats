Section|When focus firing, 
 Tip|Call out initiation so team commits “Going on this Zen.”
 Tip|Focus people who have important cooldowns down "Tracer no recall."
 Tip|Focus people with important ults up "focus Zen, he has ult."
 Tip|Call out low health targets “Ana low in the back.”
Section|Use grouping to force isolated targets off of strong positions. This can force awkward engages for the enemy team that minimize their positional advantage.
Section|When safe and missing health, let supports heal you for ult charge instead of using health packs.
Section|Good hold positioning has several aspects:
 Tip|Vision on most entrances to the area.
 Tip|Opportunities for to set up crossfire.
 Tip|Good cover and sightlines for support/range dps.
 Tip|Limited cover for the enemy team.
Section|Composition strategies:
 Tip|Look to create synergies with teammates with your picks.
 Tip|Look to counter an enemy’s strategy or player with your picks.
 Tip|6 Grouped, bullies positioning for supports/range dps as a group, then looks to initiate.
 Tip|3/3 Split, one support with each group, looks to find 2 good approaches and pincer the enemy.
 Tip|1/5 or 2/4 Flanks, 1 or 2 flankers look for positioning to go in on the backline when the enemy team initiates.
 Tip|2/4 Dive, 2 supports look to peel for each other and live, other 4 look to focus one target.
 Tip|3 dps, looks to set up crossfire where if one dps is pressured, the other 2 can kill the enemy.
 Tip|3 tanks, looks to outlive the enemy team and manage ults to win fights.
 Tip|1 Support, looks to use extra dps to outfrag the enemy. Prefers brawling fights over attrition fights.
 Tip|1 Support/Sombra, like 1 Support, but punishes poke damage in attrition fights by using health packs to quickly build EMP for every fight.
